This error message occurs when you try to run git pull and there are conflicting changes between your local branch and the remote branch you are trying to pull from.

Git is unsure how to merge the changes and it needs you to specify how you want to handle the merge. The error message provides some hints on how to handle the situation.

You can either merge the changes with the merge strategy or rebase your changes on top of the changes in the remote branch with the rebase strategy.

You can set your default preference for all repositories using the git config command with the pull.rebase or pull.ff options. You can also override the default behavior on a per-invocation basis using the --rebase, --no-rebase, or --ff-only options.

To fix the error, choose the appropriate strategy for your situation and run the appropriate command to set your preference or specify it on the command line when you run git pull. For example, to use the merge strategy, run:

git config pull.rebase false
git pull

git config pull.rebase true
git pull

git config pull.ff only
git pull

This error message occurs when you have conflicts in your working tree that need to be resolved before you can pull changes from the remote branch.

To resolve the conflicts, you need to first run git status to see which files have conflicts. The output of git status will show you which files have conflicts and which files have been modified.

To resolve the conflicts, you need to open the files with conflicts and edit them manually to remove the conflict markers and make the necessary changes to resolve the conflicts.

After you have resolved the conflicts, you need to stage the changes using git add command.

git add <file>

Once you have staged the changes, you can commit them using the git commit command.

git commit -m "Resolved conflicts"

After you have committed the changes, you can run git pull again to fetch and merge the changes from the remote branch.

If you run into conflicts during the pull, repeat the steps above to resolve the conflicts before committing your changes.
